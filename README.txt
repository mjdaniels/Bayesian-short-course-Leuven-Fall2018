# Bayesian approaches for missing data and causal inference short course

Short course on Bayesian for missing data and causal inference - September 2018

This is a guide for where to find the code for each example from the course

We will do several demonstrations.

Before the course (if you want to try things out), please download and install

 JAGS from http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net

 and the packages rjags and runjags from CRAN

 https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rjags/index.html

 https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/runjags/index.html

********************************************

Most of the below code and packages can be found at my github site, github.com/mjdaniels/ (unless otherwise noted)

***********************************
Demonstrations (I will show how to use some of the packages during the course and you are welcome to try them out during the course)

The directories for the demonstrations are in 
github.com/mjdaniels/Bayesian-approaches-for-missing-data-and-causal-inference-short-course

BNP schizophrenia nonignorable example (Day 2)
